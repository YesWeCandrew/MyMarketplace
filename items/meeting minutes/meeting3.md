## Team Meeting 3 - Week 9 - 5 October 2022 (5:00pm-5:30pm time)
**Absent: None**
<br>
**Scribe: Matthew Cawley (u7313113)**

## Agreed Procedure
The aim of this meeting is to figure out what we have completed so far, compare this to our original goals, then set new goals if they need to be changed.


## Agenda Items
| Number | Item |
| :--- | ---: |
| 1 | Review progress |
| 2 | Determine if changes to schedule are necessary |


## Meeting Minutes
- We are behind our original goals because we have all had other assignments/exams as a higher priority, but we can all start focusing on this assignment around now.
- Andrew has mostly finished his part, and will completely finish his part (having a ArrayList of basic products) tonight, so that the others can start working on storage/searching, etc., which is to be done by Tuesday.
- Discussed the idea of user reviews as an additional feature, and decided we will talk about additional features in a future meeting.
- Suggestion (not final) for sorting/storage of items, using an AVL tree based on price and quantity, and sorting by an ID when the price is the same
- Have basic app done (the stuff in TODO) by Tuesday next week in our lab, as that is our deadline for that. Decide on additional features then also.
- Should start working on report next week as well, as that is a large portion of the grade.
