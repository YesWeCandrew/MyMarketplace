## Meeting Minutes
- The meeting started by reviewing the week 7 development schedule. All tasks planned for week 7 were completed in time. Next the group examined week 8 development.
- Andrew began by demonstrating the data backend and example data he had created. He showed that the data structure and data points were complete, but that there was some difficulty importing the data into Java through Android Studio. He felt this would still get done by the end of the week.
- Vincent showed the log in screen. The development on this has been complete, but work with Matthew still needs to be done to implement search.
- Long discussed feedback from the lab checkpoint. They reviewers suggested that we prepare our report and presentation earlier.
- The group discussed the development schedule. We agreed that the deadlines for Week 8 could be pushed out to Monday/Tuesday of Week 9, but that further revisions weren't necessary.
