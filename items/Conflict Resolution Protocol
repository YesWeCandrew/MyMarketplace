# Conflict Resolution Protocol
If a member fails to meet a deadline for a task – someone (including possibly said member) takes the task who can complete it as soon as possible.
If there is a disagreement – Vote on it as a group. If this is a 2v2 tie and the nobody wants to budge to the other side then whoever’s job it was to make that part gets final say. 
If a member gets sick and is unable to complete their work, then the other members will have to be distributed their tasks, if possible with later deadlines than originally.
